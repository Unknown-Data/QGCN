# QGCN

QGCN method for graph classification

required packages:
- pytorch (optional use of GPU)
- numpy

### How to use 

To use this package you will need to provide the following files as input:

-> Graphs csv file - files that contain the graphs for input and their labels.
  The format of the file is flexible, but it must contain headers for any column, and there must be a column provided for:
  - graph id
  - source node id
  - destination node id
  - label id (every graph id can be attached to only one label)
- External data file - external data for every node (Optional)
    The format of this file is also flexible, but it must contain headers for any column, and there must be a column provided for:
    **note!! every node must get a value**
    - graph id
    - node id
    - column for every external feeture (if the value is not numeric then it can be handeled with embeddings)
<p>   
Example for such files: <br>
graph csv file: <br>
g_id,src,dst,label <br>
6678,_1,_2,i <br>
6678,_1,_3,i <br>
6678,_2,_4,i <br>
6678,_3,_5,i

<p>
External data file: <br>
g_id,node,charge,chem,symbol,x,y <br>
6678,_1,0,1,C,4.5981,-0.25 <br>
6678,_2,0,1,C,5.4641,0.25 <br>
6678,_3,0,1,C,3.7321,0.25 <br>
6678,_4,0,1,C,6.3301,-0.25 <br>

Put them both in `QGCN/dataset` directory.

-> Parameters file for each part of the algorithm. Example files can be found in `params` directory (different for binary/multiclass). Notice that if an external file is not 
provided, you should put the associated parameters as None.

Once you have these files, go to `QGCN/QGCN_model/qgcn_activator.py` and run it according to your params file.

The datasets can be download here: https://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/staff/morris/graphkerneldatasets . Notice you will have to change their format to ours. You can see an example data conventor in `datasets -> change_data_format.py`.

### Important
Do not change `graph-measures` or `graph-package` directories because they are external directories for calculating different features of graphs.
